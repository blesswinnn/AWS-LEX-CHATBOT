`üí° What is intent classification confidence score threshold?
When you're using Amazon Lex to build a chatbot, this threshold is like a minimum score for your chatbot to confidently understand what the user is trying to say.
Setting this to 0.4 means that your chatbot needs to be at least 40% confident that it understands what the user is asking to be able to give a response.
So if a user's input is ambiguous and your chatbot's confidence score is below 0.4, it'll throw an error message.

- Under Intent details, enter WelcomeIntent for the Intent name.
- Add the description Welcoming a user when they say hello.

- The ones that you have literally defined in your Utterances section will definitely work.

# But what about other utterances?
` üí° How does my chatbot respond to these user inputs?
The first three are successfully recognized - Amazon Lex is able to use its ML techniques to match what you have said against your utterances.
But the last two fail, resulting in an Intent FallbackIntent is fulfilled response - meaning Amazon Lex doesn't quite recognize your utterance.`

`üí° What is FallbackIntent?
Remember the intent classification confidence score threshold, and how it's been set to 0.4?
If your chatbot has a confidence score below 40% for all the intents you've defined (in our case, it's just the WelcomeIntent for now), the FallbackIntent is triggered.
Think of it as a custom error message that your chatbot will use to tell the user it doesn't understand their input.`

- In your left hand navigation panel, choose FallbackIntent.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a385f88f-da81-4314-886a-a5dfa129389d)

- Scroll down to Closing responses.
- Expand the arrow for Response sent to the user after the intent is fulfilled.
- In the Message field, add the following text:‚Äç
  ```Sorry I am having trouble understanding. Can you describe what you'd like to do in a few words? I can help you find your account balance, transfer funds and make a payment.```
- You'll notice another arrow next to the label Variations - optional.
- Expand the arrow.
- Enter the following text:
  ```Hmm could you try rephrasing that? I can help you find your account balance, transfer funds and make a payment.```
- Add another variation! What is another response that the chatbot could use to get clarification if it doesn't understand the user's intent?
- Choose Save intent.
- Choose Build
- Choose Test.

`üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm getting an error
Does your error say Missing required key 'sessionId' in params?
That usually means your bot needs a refresh or some time until it's ready for testing.
Select the refresh button at the top of your chatbot's chat window.
If you're still seeing the error, wait another minute before sending another message.
If you're still seeing the error, close this window and select Build and Test again.`
